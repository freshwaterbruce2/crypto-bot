# Balance Detection Issue

## Problem
The bot is now successfully collecting signals (6 signals!) but failing to execute trades because the balance manager reports only $1.97 instead of your actual balance.

## Symptoms
- `[PORTFOLIO_INTEL] State: insufficient_funds, Portfolio: $1.97, Assets: 0`
- `[EXECUTE] Trade failed: Insufficient total funds ($1.97 available, $1.97 portfolio)`
- Bot doesn't see your $161.39 USDT or your ALGO/AI16Z positions

## Possible Causes

### 1. API Connection Issues
- The balance manager might not be properly connected to Kraken API
- API credentials might be incorrect or expired
- Rate limiting might be preventing balance fetches

### 2. Cache Issues
- The balance cache might contain stale data
- The bot might be using cached data from when you had $1.97

### 3. Account Type Mismatch
- The bot might be connected to a different Kraken account
- Could be looking at a testnet/sandbox account instead of live

### 4. Balance Parsing Issue
- The bot might be misreading the API response format
- Could be looking at the wrong field in the balance data

## Immediate Actions to Try

### 1. Check API Credentials
Verify your `kraken_api_key` and `kraken_api_secret` in config.json are correct and for the right account.

### 2. Force Balance Refresh
The bot should be forcing a fresh balance fetch, but the cache might be stuck.

### 3. Check Kraken API Status
Ensure Kraken API is operational and your account has API access enabled.

### 4. Verify Account
Log into Kraken web interface and confirm:
- You have $161.39 USDT available
- API key has "Query Funds" permission enabled
- No account restrictions

## Debug Information Needed
To diagnose further, we need to see:
1. Raw balance response from Kraken API
2. Any API error messages
3. Rate limit status
4. Cache timestamps

## Next Steps
1. Restart the bot with fresh state
2. Check logs immediately after startup for balance fetch attempts
3. Look for any API errors or rate limit messages
4. Verify the bot is connecting to the correct Kraken account

The signal collection fix is working perfectly - we just need to resolve this balance detection issue to start executing trades!
