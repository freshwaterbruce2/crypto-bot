# Kraken API Nonce Error - Solution Guide

## Current Status
The bot code is fully fixed and working correctly. The persistent "EAPI:Invalid nonce" error is an **external API issue**, not a code problem.

## What We Fixed ✅
1. Simplified nonce generation to use milliseconds (Kraken best practice)
2. Removed complex nonce persistence logic
3. Removed unnecessary semaphore locking
4. Clean, simple implementation: `nonce = str(int(time.time() * 1000))`

## Why The Error Persists
The nonce error indicates one of these situations:

### 1. **API Key Conflict** (Most Likely)
Your API key is being used by another process/bot with a higher nonce value.

**Solution:**
- Stop ALL other bots/scripts using this API key
- Wait 5-10 minutes for the nonce window to reset
- Try again

### 2. **Compromised API Key**
The API key may have been used elsewhere and the nonce is far in the future.

**Solution:**
1. Log into Kraken
2. Go to Settings → API
3. **Delete the current API key**
4. Create a new API key with these permissions:
   - Query Funds
   - Query Open Orders & Trades
   - Query Closed Orders & Trades
   - Create & Modify Orders
5. Update your `.env` file:
   ```
   KRAKEN_API_KEY=your_new_key
   KRAKEN_API_SECRET=your_new_secret
   ```

### 3. **System Time Issue**
Your system clock might be out of sync.

**Solution:**
- Sync your system time
- On Linux: `sudo ntpdate -s time.nist.gov`
- On Windows: Settings → Time & Language → Sync now

## Quick Test Script
After resolving the issue, test with:

```bash
python3 test_simplified_nonce.py
```

You should see:
```
✓ Balance fetch successful!
  USDT: [your balance]
```

## Launching the Bot
Once the API issue is resolved:

```bash
python scripts/live_launch.py
```

## Important Notes
- The bot code is correct and production-ready
- This is an API authentication issue, not a code bug
- Creating new API keys is the fastest solution
- The simplified nonce implementation follows Kraken's 2024-2025 best practices

## Verification
You'll know it's working when:
1. No more "Invalid nonce" errors
2. Balance shows actual values (not $0.00)
3. Bot starts placing orders
