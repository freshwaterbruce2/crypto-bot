# WebSocket V2 Real-Time Balance Fixes

## Date: 2025-07-06

## Problem
The bot was making REST API calls for balance data instead of using WebSocket v2, causing nonce errors ("EAPI:Invalid nonce").

## Root Cause
1. Balance manager was created before WebSocket connection was established
2. WebSocket private channel message handler wasn't properly set up
3. Real-time balance manager wasn't correctly parsing Kraken's balance message format
4. Bot wasn't waiting for WebSocket balance data before starting

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed WebSocket Manager (`websocket_manager_v2.py`)
- Enhanced private message handler setup with multiple SDK version support
- Added detailed logging for balance message handling
- Fixed message format parsing to handle both array and object formats from Kraken

### 2. Fixed Real-Time Balance Manager (`real_time_balance_manager.py`)
- Updated `_handle_balance_update` to parse Kraken's actual WebSocket message format
- Added support for array format: `[channelID, data, channelName, pair]`
- Enhanced balance data parsing to handle multiple Kraken balance formats
- Prevented REST API fallback after initialization period (30 seconds)

### 3. Fixed Bot Initialization (`bot.py`)
- Deferred balance manager creation until after WebSocket connection
- Ensured WebSocket connects and private channels are established before creating balance manager
- Added WebSocket balance helper integration to wait for balance data

### 4. Enhanced Balance Manager (`enhanced_balance_manager.py`)
- Already had code to prefer WebSocket data over REST
- Added logging to track when WebSocket vs REST is used

### 5. Created Helper Utilities
- `websocket_balance_helper.py` - Ensures WebSocket balance data is available
- `test_websocket_balance.py` - Debug script to test WebSocket connectivity

## Expected Behavior After Fixes
1. Bot connects to WebSocket v2 first
2. Private channels are established for balance updates
3. Balance manager uses real-time WebSocket data
4. NO REST API calls for balance during normal operation
5. Nonce errors should be eliminated

## Testing
Run the test script to verify WebSocket balance connectivity:
```bash
python scripts/test_websocket_balance.py
```

## Key Points
- WebSocket v2 provides real-time balance updates without API calls
- The bot should NEVER make REST balance calls after initialization
- All balance data comes from the `balances` WebSocket channel
- Nonce errors indicate REST API usage when WebSocket should be used
