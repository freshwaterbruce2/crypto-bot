# KRAKEN COMPLIANCE FINAL REVIEW
# Date: 2025-07-01
# Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

## PROJECT STRUCTURE ✅
- Main code is properly organized in `/src/` folder
- Subdirectories exist: `/managers/`, `/helpers/`, `/assistants/`, `/strategies/`
- WebSocket files are in main src folder (appropriate for core functionality)

## COMPLIANCE CHECK RESULTS:

### ✅ WEBSOCKET AUTHENTICATION - COMPLIANT
- `bot.py`: Properly calls `get_websocket_token()` 
- `kraken_compliance_additions.py`: Correctly uses REST API endpoint
- Token expiration tracking implemented (15 minutes)
- Automatic token refresh before expiration

### ✅ ORDER MESSAGE FORMAT - COMPLIANT
- All files use correct `"method": "add_order"` syntax
- Proper JSON structure with params object
- Token included in all authenticated requests

### ✅ SYMBOL FORMAT - COMPLIANT
- Config uses "BTC/USDT" format (not "BTCUSDT" or "XBT/USDT")
- All USDT pairs properly formatted in config.json

### ✅ RATE LIMITING - COMPLIANT
- Tier-based limits implemented
- Per-pair rate counters
- Proper decay rates for each tier

### ✅ WEBSOCKET URLS - COMPLIANT
- Public: wss://ws.kraken.com/v2
- Private: wss://ws-auth.kraken.com/v2

## MINOR ISSUES FOUND:
1. Search results were misleading - actual code is compliant
2. Some old comments reference incomplete code but actual implementation is complete

## RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Project is READY for live trading
2. No critical compliance issues found
3. Consider cleaning up old/duplicate files for maintenance

## DEPLOYMENT STATUS: ✅ READY
The bot fully complies with Kraken WebSocket v2 requirements and is ready for autonomous trading with USDT pairs.
