# Tier 1 Trading Optimization Guide
## Fee-Free Micro-Profit Strategy

### Why Low-Priced Pairs Are Optimal for Tier 1

#### The Problem with High-Priced Pairs
1. **Capital Inefficiency**: BTC at $40,000+ ties up significant capital for minimal trades
2. **Lower Percentage Movements**: BTC moving $100 = 0.25%, but DOGE moving $0.01 = 10%
3. **Higher Minimum Requirements**: BTC/USD often requires $10-20 minimum trades

### Optimal Tier 1 Trading Pairs

#### Priority 1: Ultra-Low Price, Maximum Volatility
- **SHIB/USDT** (~$0.00001): Extreme volatility, perfect for micro-profits
- **DOGE/USDT** (~$0.10): High liquidity, frequent 1-2% moves

#### Priority 2: Low Price, Excellent Liquidity
- **TRX/USDT** (~$0.05): Decent volatility, low entry barrier
- **ADA/USDT** (~$0.50): Consistent patterns, excellent for the strategy
- **XRP/USDT** (~$0.50): High liquidity, good movement

#### Priority 3: Supporting Pairs
- **ALGO/USDT** (~$0.20): Frequent micro-movements
- **MATIC/USDT** (~$0.80): Consistent patterns
- **DOT/USDT** (~$5): Still accessible, good swings

### Configuration Optimizations Made

1. **Removed High-Priced Pairs**: BTC, ETH, MKR, YFI, COMP
2. **Tightened Profit Targets**: 0.03% - 0.1% for ultra-fast exits
3. **Increased Position Multipliers**: For low-priced pairs (up to 2x for SHIB)
4. **Reduced Hold Times**: Max 15 minutes for positions
5. **Enabled Snowball Tracking**: To compound micro-profits

### Trading Strategy Adjustments
