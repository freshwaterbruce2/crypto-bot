# Runtime Fixes - July 8, 2025

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing `get_next_action` Method in InfinityTradingManager
**Issue**: The bot was calling `infinity_manager.get_next_action()` but the method didn't exist.
**Fix**: Added the `get_next_action` method to InfinityTradingManager that:
- Returns validated trading signals from the assistants
- Checks capital availability before returning signals
- Integrates with the existing signal batch system

### 2. Hardcoded $5.00 Order Size Exceeding Tier-1 Limit
**Issue**: Bot was attempting $5.00 orders when tier-1 limit is $2.00
**Fix**: Updated bot.py line 1521 and 1524 to use `MINIMUM_ORDER_SIZE_TIER1` constant instead of hardcoded 5.0

### 3. Missing `log_event` Method in LoggingAnalyticsAssistant
**Issue**: AssistantManager was calling `log_event` which didn't exist
**Fix**: Added the `log_event` method to LoggingAnalyticsAssistant that:
- Logs events to appropriate buffers based on event type
- Manages buffer cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Updates performance metrics

### 4. TradingState Capital Flow Initialization
**Issue**: `capital_flow` attribute was not initialized in TradingState dataclass
**Fix**: Added proper field initialization using `field(default_factory=...)` with default capital flow structure

### 5. Missing Error Counts Tracking
**Issue**: `error_counts` attribute was referenced but not initialized
**Fix**: Added `self.error_counts = {}` initialization in InfinityTradingManager.__init__

### 6. Undefined Variables in emergency_shutdown
**Issue**: `error_type` and `error` variables were undefined in emergency_shutdown method
**Fix**: Removed the problematic code that was using undefined variables

## Test Results
✅ All imports working correctly
✅ Bot initializes without errors
✅ InfinityTradingManager properly integrated
✅ Position size correctly set to $2.00 for tier-1
✅ All components initialize properly

## Next Steps
1. Monitor bot execution for any remaining runtime errors
2. Verify trades execute at correct $2.00 size
3. Check that InfinityTradingManager signals are being processed
4. Monitor logging and analytics system performance
