# Debug Summary - July 8, 2025

## Issues Fixed ✅

1. **WebSocket Blocking Main Loop**
   - **Problem**: WebSocket `run()` method had infinite loop blocking main bot loop
   - **Fix**: Changed WebSocket `run()` to return immediately since SDK manages its own loop
   - **Result**: Bot now enters main trading loop successfully

2. **Double Initialization** 
   - **Problem**: Bot was initialized twice (in launch script and in run method)
   - **Fix**: Removed initialization from launch script, let bot.run() handle it
   - **Result**: Cleaner startup sequence

3. **InfinityTradingManager Not Started**
   - **Problem**: Manager was created but never started
   - **Fix**: Added InfinityTradingManager to background tasks in bot.run()
   - **Result**: Manager now runs but needs more debugging

## Remaining Issues ❌

1. **Balance Showing $0.00**
   - Balance manager loads assets but returns $0.00 for USDT
   - Initial capital showed $18.85 during startup
   - Need to debug balance retrieval in unified_balance_manager.py

2. **Hardcoded $5.00 Minimum**
   - Bot still trying to execute $5.00 trades despite tier-1 limit of $2.00
   - Already fixed in bot.py but other components may have hardcoded values
   - Need to search and replace all instances

3. **Generating SELL Signals Instead of BUY**
   - Bot is trying to sell positions it doesn't have
   - Should be generating BUY signals to open positions
   - Need to check signal generation logic

4. **InfinityTradingManager Not Generating Signals**
   - Manager is running but not producing signals
   - Need to verify assistants are working properly

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Balance Manager**
   ```python
   # Check get_balance_for_asset('USDT') method
   # Ensure it returns actual balance not 0
   ```

2. **Find All $5.00 Hardcoded Values**
   ```bash
   grep -rn "5\.0\|5\.00" src/ --include="*.py"
   ```

3. **Fix Signal Type**
   - Ensure signals have correct 'side': 'buy' not 'sell'
   - Check opportunity_scanner.py

4. **Debug InfinityTradingManager**
   - Add logging to see if signals are being generated
   - Check if assistants are initializing properly

## Current Bot Status

- ✅ Initializes successfully
- ✅ Enters main trading loop
- ✅ Generates signals (wrong type)
- ❌ Cannot execute trades (balance issues)
- ❌ Using wrong minimum order size
- ❌ Trying to sell instead of buy
