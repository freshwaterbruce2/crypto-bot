### Agent Setup and File Access
- MCP claude-flow agents have FULL file system access through AgentToolsBridge
- Agents can read, write, edit, delete files and run bash commands like Claude Code
- All agent tools are in src/utils/agent_tools_bridge.py
- Agents are NOT just read-only - they can make real changes

### File Persistence
- ALL files saved to /mnt/c/dev/tools/crypto-trading-bot-2025/
- Maps to Windows C:\dev\tools\crypto-trading-bot-2025\
- Files are permanent and accessible from Windows Explorer, VS Code
- WSL2 is accessing Windows C: drive, not temporary Linux storage

### Code Duplication Status
- Successfully eliminated duplicate functions across project
- Created unified utilities: position_sizing.py, duplicate_prevention.py, unified_balance.py
- Removed 8 duplicate calculate_position_size functions
- Pre-commit hook prevents new duplicates
- Project is clean with no duplicate files

### Important Instructions
- Use agents for real file operations, not just research
- Remember file locations are permanent Windows files
- Keep agents equipped with full tool access
- Maintain duplicate prevention systems
