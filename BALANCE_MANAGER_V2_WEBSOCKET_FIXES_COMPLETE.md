# Balance Manager V2 WebSocket Connectivity Fixes - Complete Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive fixes for Balance Manager V2 WebSocket connectivity issues that were preventing proper initialization and balance streaming. The fixes address authentication token flow, connection management, and provide robust fallback mechanisms.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. WebSocket Authentication Token Flow ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Authentication tokens were obtained but not properly passed to the balance stream
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced `_obtain_auth_token()` method with better error handling
- Added token validation and retry mechanisms
- Implemented proper token refresh workflows

### 2. WebSocket Client Reference Issues ‚úÖ  
**Problem**: Balance stream received WebSocket client but it wasn't properly connected/authenticated
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `_setup_websocket_integration()` with comprehensive connectivity checks
- Added multiple connection status validation methods
- Implemented timeout handling for connection attempts

### 3. Balance Subscription Authentication ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Balance subscription failed due to missing or invalid authentication
**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote `_subscribe_to_balance_channel()` with enhanced authentication handling
- Added automatic token refresh on authentication failure
- Implemented subscription confirmation with timeout handling
- Added detailed error analysis for permission/credential issues

### 4. Initialization Sequence Problems ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Balance Manager V2 tried to initialize before WebSocket was ready
**Solution**:
- Implemented phased initialization in `initialize()` method
- Added `_initialize_rest_only_mode()` and `_initialize_rest_fallback_mode()` 
- Added timeout handling for each initialization phase
- Created automatic fallback to REST-only mode when WebSocket fails

### 5. Missing Fallback Mechanisms ‚úÖ
**Problem**: No robust fallback when WebSocket connections fail
**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive REST-only fallback mode
- Added intelligent degradation from WebSocket-primary to REST-only
- Implemented proper cleanup on initialization failures

## New Features Implemented

- `validate_connection_readiness()`: Validates if WebSocket is ready for Balance Manager V2
- `ensure_ready_for_balance_manager()`: Automatically fixes readiness issues
- Enhanced authentication with multiple fallback methods
- Comprehensive error analysis and user guidance

### Balance Manager V2 Improvements  
- Phased initialization with proper error handling
