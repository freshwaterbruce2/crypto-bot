# Signal Flow Diagnostic Summary

## Current Status
- **Signals Generated**: YES ✓ (Strategies are creating signals)
- **Signals Formatted**: FIXED ✓ (Now handles type→side conversion)
- **Signals Collected**: SHOULD WORK NOW ✓
- **Trades Executed**: TBD (Depends on signal collection)

## Signal Flow Path
1. **Strategy Level** (fast_start_strategy.py)
   - Generates signals with: `type`, `symbol`, `confidence`
   - Example: `{'type': 'buy', 'symbol': 'DOGE/USDT', 'confidence': 0.6}`
   - Status: WORKING ✓

2. **Strategy Manager** (functional_strategy_manager.py)
   - Method: `check_all_strategies_concurrent()`
   - Calls `_format_signal_for_kraken()` to format signals
   - Previously: Expected `side` field, got `type` field
   - Now: FIXED to convert `type` → `side`
   - Status: FIXED ✓

3. **Bot Collection** (bot.py)
   - Calls `strategy_manager.check_all_strategies_concurrent()`
   - Collects formatted signals into `all_signals` list
   - Logs "Total signals collected: X"
   - Status: SHOULD WORK NOW ✓

4. **Signal Validation** (bot.py)
   - Checks confidence threshold (0.25 now, was 0.5)
   - Validates symbol has USDT
   - Status: CONFIGURED ✓

5. **Trade Execution** (enhanced_trade_executor.py)
   - Executes validated signals
   - Status: READY ✓

## What Was Fixed
1. **Field Translation**: `_format_signal_for_kraken` now converts:
   - `type` → `side`
   - `symbol` → `pair` (if needed)

2. **Confidence Threshold**: Lowered from 0.5 to 0.25 for more signals

3. **Balance Manager**: Added compatibility method for `get_available_balance`

## Expected Logs After Fix
```
[STRATEGY] DOGE/USDT: Raw signal: {'type': 'buy', ...}
[SIGNAL_ACCEPTED] Formatted signal: DOGE/USDT buy conf=0.60
[SIGNAL_COLLECTED] DOGE/USDT: buy signal with confidence=0.60
[BOT] Total signals collected: 1
[BOT] Signal 1: DOGE/USDT buy confidence=0.60
[BOT] Signal passed validation: DOGE/USDT buy
```

## Action Required
1. **Restart the bot** to apply the signal format fix
2. **Monitor logs** for the expected output above
3. **Verify trades execute** when signals are collected

## If Still Not Working
1. Check if strategies are in "Ready" status
2. Verify WebSocket is receiving market data
3. Ensure balance manager is connected
4. Check for rate limiting blocks
