# Confidence Threshold Fixes - Signal Optimization

## Problem Identified
- 53,281 signals were being rejected due to high confidence thresholds
- Default thresholds were too conservative (0.5-0.6 minimum)
- Bot was missing many trading opportunities

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Config.json Updates
- **Main threshold**: Lowered from 0.55 to 0.30
- **Buy threshold**: Set to 0.3 (30%)
- **Sell threshold**: Set to 0.2 (20%) 
- **Emergency threshold**: Added at 0.1 (10%)
- **Added emergency_mode toggle**: false by default

### 2. Bot.py Core Logic Updates
- **HFT threshold**: Lowered from 0.3 to 0.1
- **Normal trading threshold**: Lowered from 0.5 to 0.2
- **Added buy/sell specific logic**: Different thresholds for buy vs sell
- **Emergency mode support**: Can drop to 0.1 confidence when enabled

### 3. Configuration Structure
```json
"confidence_thresholds": {
  "minimum": 0.3,
  "preferred": 0.4,
  "immediate": 0.5,
  "emergency": 0.1,
  "buy": 0.3,
  "sell": 0.2
}
```

### 4. Emergency Mode Script
Created `enable_emergency_mode.py` for quick threshold adjustments:
- `python enable_emergency_mode.py enable` - Drops to 0.1 threshold
- `python enable_emergency_mode.py disable` - Returns to normal
- `python enable_emergency_mode.py status` - Check current settings

## Expected Impact
- **More signals accepted**: ~70-80% increase in accepted signals
- **Faster trading**: Lower thresholds = more opportunities
- **Better exits**: Sell threshold at 0.2 ensures positions can exit
- **Emergency fallback**: Can drop to 0.1 if needed

## Monitoring
Watch for:
- Signal acceptance rate improvement
- False positive rate (bad trades)
- Overall profitability impact

## Rollback Plan
If too many false signals:
1. Run `python enable_emergency_mode.py disable`
2. Edit config.json to raise thresholds
3. Restart bot

## Files Modified
- `/config.json` - Main configuration
- `/src/core/bot.py` - Core validation logic
- `/enable_emergency_mode.py` - Emergency control script
