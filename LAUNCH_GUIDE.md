# Trading Bot Launch Guide - Post-Fix Edition

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Portfolio Intelligence Fix âœ…
- **Issue**: Bot reported "insufficient funds" when USDT balance was low ($0.23) even though capital was deployed in positions
- **Fix**: Changed balance check from `<=` to `<` in RiskAssistant (line 100)
- **Added**: `get_portfolio_state()` and `validate_trade_minimums()` methods to PortfolioIntelligence

### 2. Minimum Order Size Learning âœ…
- **Issue**: Bot didn't learn from Kraken's minimum order size errors
- **Fix**: Created `autonomous_minimum_learning` module that learns from errors
- **Integration**: 
  - Trade executor now learns from "minimum not met" errors
  - Buy assistant uses learned minimums for position sizing

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Run the Test Script
```bash
python scripts/test_fixes.py
```

This will verify:
- Portfolio Intelligence correctly identifies deployed capital
- Minimum learning system is working
- All integrations are properly connected

### 2. Launch the Bot

For production autonomous trading:
```bash
python scripts/infinity_loop_launch.py
```

For testing with live data:
```bash
python scripts/live_launch.py
```

## What to Monitor

### 1. Check Logs for Portfolio Intelligence
Look for these log messages in `kraken_infinity_bot.log`:
- `[RISK] Low USDT balance ($X), checking deployed funds...`
- `[PORTFOLIO_INTEL] Not blocking trade - capital is deployed, not missing`
- `[EXECUTION] Low free balance but sufficient portfolio value`

### 2. Check Minimum Learning in Action
Watch for:
- `[MINIMUM_LEARNING] Learned new minimum requirements for BTC/USDT`
- `[BUY_ASSISTANT] Suggested amount for BTC/USDT: $X (reason)`
- `[EXECUTION] Learned new minimum requirements`

### 3. Monitor Trading Activity
The bot should now:
- Continue trading even with low USDT balance if capital is deployed
- Learn from minimum order errors and adjust future trades
- Make smarter position sizing decisions

## Troubleshooting

### If "insufficient funds" errors still occur:
1. Check that portfolio has actual deployed positions
2. Verify the total portfolio value exceeds the trade amount
3. Check logs for portfolio state analysis

### If minimum orders still fail:
1. Check `trading_data/minimum_learning/kraken_learned_minimums.json`
2. Verify the learning events in `trading_data/minimum_learning/learning_events.json`
3. Ensure the suggested amounts meet Kraken's requirements

## Expected Behavior

With these fixes, your bot will:
1. **Snowball profits** by continuing to trade with deployed capital
2. **Learn and adapt** to Kraken's minimum requirements automatically
3. **Maximize fee-free advantage** with optimal position sizing
4. **Avoid false stops** when capital is working in positions

## Success Metrics

Monitor these in your logs:
- Reduction in "insufficient funds" errors
- Successful trades with low USDT balance
- Learned minimums preventing order rejections
- Continuous profit accumulation

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the bot for 24-48 hours
2. Check that profits are accumulating (snowball effect)
3. Verify no false "insufficient funds" stops
4. Watch the minimum learning improve order success rate

Good luck with your profitable trading! ðŸš€
