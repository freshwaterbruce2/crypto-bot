# UniversalLearningManager Fix Applied

## Issue
```
[WARNING] [root] - [INIT] Learning system initialization failed: 'UniversalLearningManager' object has no attribute 'logger'
```

## Root Cause
The `_setup_event_subscriptions()` method was being called before `self.logger` was assigned, causing an AttributeError when it tried to log a message.

## Fix Applied
Moved the `_setup_event_subscriptions()` call to the end of the `__init__` method, after all attributes (including `self.logger`) have been properly initialized.

### Changed in `/src/learning/universal_learning_manager.py`:
1. Removed `_setup_event_subscriptions()` from line 152 (too early in init)
2. Added it to line 215 (after all initialization complete)

## Result
The UniversalLearningManager will now:
- Initialize properly without errors
- Subscribe to all event bus events for automatic learning
- Track trading patterns and errors
- Learn from failures to improve performance

## Verification
You should now see:
```
[INFO] [src.learning.universal_learning_manager] - [LEARNING] Subscribed to event bus for automatic learning
[INFO] [src.learning.universal_learning_manager] - [LEARNING] Loaded X events and Y error patterns from storage
```

Without any AttributeError warnings.
