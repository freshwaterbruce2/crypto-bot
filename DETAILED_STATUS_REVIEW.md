# Detailed Status Review - Crypto Trading Bot

## Current Situation (2025-07-13 08:48)

### 🤖 Bot Status
- **Running**: Yes (PID: 61707, 29+ hours uptime)
- **Automated Workflow**: Active (PID: 65801)
- **Activity**: Continuously attempting trades

### 📊 What's Working Correctly
1. **Balance Detection**: ✅ All positions detected correctly
   - ATOM: 5.581
   - AVAX: 2.331
   - ALGO: 113.682
   - And others ($201+ total)

2. **Circuit Breaker**: ✅ Not blocking (timeout reduced to 30s)

3. **Signal Generation**: ✅ Producing buy/sell signals

4. **Risk Management**: ✅ Allowing trades ($2.00 minimum)

### ❌ Current Issues Preventing Trades

1. **Type Comparison Error**
   - Error: `'>' not supported between instances of 'dict' and 'int'`
   - Occurs after balance detection, during order preparation
   - Preventing all trade execution

2. **Malformed Order Payload**
   - Error: `The request payload is malformed, incorrect or ambiguous`
   - When bot tries to place order with Kraken API
   - Suggests order parameters are incorrectly formatted

3. **Minimum Learning Error**
   - Error: `'MinimumDiscoveryLearning' object has no attribute '_analyze_and_warn_problematic_pairs'`
   - Non-critical but indicates incomplete implementation

### 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The bot is stuck in a loop where:
1. It correctly identifies trading opportunities ✅
2. It properly detects all balances ✅
3. It fails when creating the order due to:
   - Type comparison error (dict vs int)
   - Malformed API request format

### 🛠️ What the Automated Workflow Should Do

The `automated_fix_workflow.py` is designed to:
1. Detect these errors ✅ (It's running)
2. Apply targeted fixes
3. Restart bot if needed
4. Continue until profitable

However, it may need assistance with the specific type error.

### 🚀 Recommended Actions

1. **Check Automated Workflow Progress**:
   ```bash
   cat automated_workflow.log
   ```

2. **Manual Type Error Fix**:
   The type comparison error is likely in the order creation logic where a response dict is being compared to an integer.

3. **Order Payload Issue**:
   The Kraken API is rejecting orders due to incorrect formatting.

### 📈 Progress Summary
- **7/10 major issues fixed** (70%)
- **3 remaining issues** blocking trades
- Bot has been attempting trades for 29+ hours
- All infrastructure is working except final order execution

The automated system should eventually fix these issues, but manual intervention could speed up the process.
