# Trading Bot Stability Plan: Error Handling & Code Finalization

## Current Issues

I'm running a crypto trading bot that's mostly working but has some persistent issues that need to be fixed. Based on the logs, here are the main problems:

1. **Exchange Connection Issues**:

   ```
   [ERROR] [src.exchange.native_kraken_exchange] - [KRAKEN] Private request error: Cannot connect to host api.kraken.com:443 ssl:default [Timeout while contacting DNS servers]
   [ERROR] [src.exchange.native_kraken_exchange] - [KRAKEN] Error fetching balance: Cannot connect to host api.kraken.com:443 ssl:default [Timeout while contacting DNS servers]
   ```

2. **System Health Warnings**:

   ```
   [WARNING] [root] - [HEALTH] 1 unhealthy components: ['exchange']
   ```

3. **Strategy Timeout Issues**:
   ```
   [WARNING] [root] - [BOT] Strategy check timed out after 5s
   ```

## Objectives

1. Implement robust error handling for API connection issues
2. Create a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for exchange API calls
3. Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent repeated failed API calls
4. Implement proper health monitoring and recovery procedures
5. Fix strategy timeout issues
6. Lock down files that are working correctly to prevent regressions

## Tasks

### Task 1: Improve Exchange Connection Reliability

Analyze and fix the `native_kraken_exchange.py` file to handle connection issues gracefully:

- Add proper exception handling
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add connection pooling if appropriate
- Handle DNS resolution failures specifically

### Task 2: Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern

Create a circuit breaker to prevent overwhelming the exchange API during outages:

- Add circuit breaker state (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF-OPEN)
- Track failure counts and success rates
- Automatically switch to fallback behavior during outages
- Gradually recover when API becomes available again

### Task 3: Fix Strategy Timeout Issues

Modify the strategy execution to prevent timeouts:

- Add timeout handling to strategy calls
- Implement asynchronous strategy execution where appropriate
- Add monitoring for slow-running strategies
- Gracefully handle strategy failures without affecting the main loop

### Task 4: Enhance Health Monitoring System

Improve the health monitoring to provide better diagnostics and recovery:

- Create detailed health checks for each component
- Add self-healing capabilities where possible
- Implement proper alerting for persistent issues
- Add metrics collection for system performance

### Task 5: Code Finalization and Locking

Identify and lock down stable components:

- Create a process for marking files as "stable"
- Add version control tags for stable versions
- Implement regression tests for stable components
- Document stable interfaces

## Code Areas to Focus On

1. `src/exchange/native_kraken_exchange.py` - Fix connection issues
2. `src/trading/enhanced_balance_manager.py` - Ensure resilience to API failures
3. `src/strategies/` - Fix timeout issues in strategy execution
4. Health monitoring system - Enhance with better diagnostics and recovery

## Additional Context

The bot is currently running and processing market data successfully:

```
[INFO] [root] - [HIST_SAVER] Saved 10 records for CRO/USDT 1m interval
[INFO] [root] - [HIST_SAVER] Saved 10 records for DOT/USDT 1m interval
[INFO] [root] - [HIST_SAVER] Saved 10 records for DAI/USDT 1m interval
```

The main loop is stable and running consistently:

```
[INFO] [root] - [BOT] ?? Main loop heartbeat - iteration 290
[INFO] [root] - [BOT] ?? Main loop heartbeat - iteration 300
```

Portfolio tracking is working:

```
[INFO] [src.trading.enhanced_balance_manager] - [EBM_USDT] Portfolio: $161.39 (used 0/12 API calls)
[INFO] [src.trading.enhanced_balance_manager] - [EBM] Portfolio value: $161.39
```

Please help me implement these improvements to make the trading bot more robust and reliable. Focus on making the system resilient to external API failures while maintaining trading functionality.
