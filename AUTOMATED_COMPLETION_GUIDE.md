   ```

2. **Verify Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Check Bot Status**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep live_launch.py
   ```

4. **Review Logs**
   ```bash
   tail -100 master_finisher.log
   ```

## 📈 Post-Completion

After successful completion:

1. **Monitor Performance**
   - Let bot run for 24 hours
