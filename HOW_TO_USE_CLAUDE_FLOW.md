# Using Claude-Flow to Build Your Trading Bot

Claude-Flow is your AI development assistant. Here's how to use it to help build your crypto trading bot:

## Quick Start
```bash
# Install Claude-Flow (one time only)
npm install -g claude-flow@alpha

# Initialize it (one time only)
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force
```

## Development Commands

### 1. Planning & Architecture
```bash
# Get help designing your bot architecture
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "Design Python crypto trading bot with CCXT"

# Plan your database schema
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "Design SQLite schema for tracking trades"
```

### 2. Code Generation
```bash
# Generate trading strategy code
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "Write Python scalping strategy for DOGE"

# Create order management system
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "Create order placement module with error handling"
```

### 3. Problem Solving
```bash
# Debug issues
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "Debug WebSocket connection to exchange"

# Optimize performance
npx claude-flow@alpha cognitive analyze --behavior "trading-loop-optimization"
```

### 4. Testing & Validation
```bash
# Generate test cases
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "Create pytest tests for trading logic"

# Review code quality
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "Review Python code for best practices"
```

## Your Trading Bot Development Flow

1. **Start each session** by reminding Claude-Flow about your project:
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow@alpha memory query "current_project"
   ```

2. **Get specific help** for your current task:
   ```bash
   # Example: Working on order execution
   npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "Implement fee-free order execution with retries"
   ```

3. **Save important decisions** to memory:
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow@alpha memory store "exchange_choice" "Robinhood Crypto"
   npx claude-flow@alpha memory store "risk_per_trade" "1% of portfolio"
   ```

## Tips for Maximum Productivity

- Be specific in your requests
- Break complex tasks into smaller ones
- Use memory to track decisions and progress
- Review generated code before implementing

## Example Development Session

```bash
# Morning: Plan the day
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "What should I focus on today for my trading bot?"

# Implement a feature
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "Create profit tracking module"

# End of day: Save progress
npx claude-flow@alpha memory store "completed_today" "Implemented profit tracking"
```

Remember: Claude-Flow is your AI assistant, not part of your trading bot!
