# Optimize Trading Strategy

Optimize trading strategy parameters and thresholds for better performance.

## Command Usage
`/optimize-strategy [parameter] [target_metric]`

## Action
Analyze and optimize trading strategy parameters based on historical performance and market conditions.

Optimization targets for $ARGUMENTS:
- **thresholds**: Signal generation thresholds (momentum, confidence, volume)
- **timing**: Entry/exit timing and market conditions
- **sizing**: Position sizing and capital allocation
- **risk**: Risk management parameters and stop-losses
- **frequency**: Trading frequency and opportunity windows

Optimization process:
1. Analyze recent trading performance and outcomes
2. Review current parameter settings and their effectiveness
3. Identify underperforming areas and improvement opportunities
4. Backtest parameter changes against historical data
5. Calculate impact on key metrics (profit, risk, frequency)
6. Recommend optimal parameter adjustments
7. Implement changes with proper validation

Key metrics to optimize:
- Profit per trade and overall ROI
- Signal accuracy and success rate
- Risk-adjusted returns and Sharpe ratio
- Capital efficiency and utilization
- Drawdown minimization

Provide specific parameter recommendations with expected performance improvements and implementation steps.
